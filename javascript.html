                    <h5 class="card-title">Often abbreviated as JS</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">Is a programming language and core technology of the World Wide Web,
                        alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior,
                        often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute
                        the code on users' devices.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.
                        It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven,
                        functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates,
                        regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage,
                        or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components
                        of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995. It was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997.
                        After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser. Mozilla's latest version was 1.8.5.
                        (Identical to ES5). Internet Explorer (IE4) was the first browser to support ECMA-262 Edition 1 (ES1).
